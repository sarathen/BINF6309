##Overview
The two main steps in performing differential expression analysis are to
estimate the relative abundance of transcripts, and to apply statistical models
to test for differential expression between treatment groups. Estimating
relative abundance is basically determining how many NGS reads match a given
gene within a genome. In this module you'll use Salmon [@Patro] to estimate
relative abundance, tximport [@Soneson] to import the Salmon abundance
estimates, and DESeq2 [@Love] to perform statistical tests to identify
differentially expressed genes.
